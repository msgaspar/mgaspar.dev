              Hey, it's nice to have you here! I'm Matheus, a brazilian web
              developer who's fascinated about how technology can make our lives
              easier, solve annoying problems and help making the world a better
              place. And one of the things I enjoy the most is being able to
              make these things happen by writing code. I also love enjoying
              nature, traveling, cooking, reading a good book and spending time
              with my family and friends.
            </p>
            <p>
              I graduated in Civil Engineering in 2016 and earned a master's
              degree in Transportation Engineering in 2019, both at the
              University of SÃ£o Paulo. During those years I dedicated myself to
              scientific research, and soon after that I decided on a career
              change to work with something I knew I really enjoyed -
              programming.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I'm studying for a degree in System Analysis and
              Development at the Senac University Center, and I'm entering the
              final module of the web development course at <TrybeLink />. I'm
              also looking for my first developer job opportunity, and I feel
              this is just the beginning of an amazing journey.
