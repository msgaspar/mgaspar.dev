            Hey, it's nice to have you here! I'm Matheus, a brazilian web
            developer who's fascinated about how technology can make our lives
            easier, solve annoying problems and help making the world a better
            place. And one of the things I enjoy the most is being able to make
            these things happen by writing code. I also love enjoying nature,
            traveling, cooking, reading a good book and spending time with my
            family and friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            I graduated in Civil Engineering in 2016 and earned a master's
            degree in Transportation Engineering in 2019, both at the University
            of SÃ£o Paulo. During those years I dedicated myself to scientific
            research, and soon after that I decided on a career change to work
            with something I knew I really enjoyed - programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I'm studying for a degree in System Analysis and
            Development at the Senac University Center, and I'm entering the
            final module of the web development course at <TrybeLink />. I'm
            also looking for my first developer job opportunity, and I feel this
            is just the beginning of an amazing journey.
